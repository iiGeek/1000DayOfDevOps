# 🚀 Day 1 — Operating System Internals  
**Part of my 1000 Days DevOps Journey**

Today I completed the first official day of my DevOps journey.  
Instead of jumping into tools, I focused on understanding **how an operating system actually works inside**, because DevOps depends heavily on knowing what is happening behind the scenes.

This was a deep and important day.

## 🧠 Operating System Concepts I Learned

### 🔹 1. What is a Process?
A process is a running program inside the OS.  
It receives:
- CPU time  
- Memory  
- Resources  

I learned how processes move through states:  
**New → Ready → Running → Waiting → Terminated**

### 🔹 2. Process vs Thread
- A **process** = a full program with its own memory  
- A **thread** = a lightweight worker inside the process  
- Processes are isolated, but threads share memory

### 🔹 3. CPU & Process Relationship
- CPU executes one thread at a time  
- OS switches between processes using “context switching”  
- This explains why some programs lag or freeze

### 🔹 4. Why Programs Use RAM Differently
- Some apps load more data into memory  
- Background threads use extra memory  
- Heavy apps reserve large memory blocks  

### 🔹 5. CPU Scheduling Basics
I learned how the CPU decides *which process runs next* using algorithms:
- FCFS (First Come First Served)  
- SJF (Shortest Job First)  
- Round Robin  

These algorithms keep the system fast and responsive.
